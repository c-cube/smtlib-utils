# Smtlib-utils [![Build](https://github.com/c-cube/smtlib-utils/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/c-cube/smtlib-utils/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Parser for [SMTLIB2]([200~http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/), in OCaml, along
with some utilities for my own usage. It depends on menhir.

For a more advanced parser that is spec-compliant, see [Dolmen](https://github.com/Gbury/dolmen/).
